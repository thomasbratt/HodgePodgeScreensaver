HodgePodge Screensaver
======================

A screensaver written in C# and WPF.

The screensaver is inspired by a nonlinear chemical oscillator called the 
Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction and the description of a simplification of
this reaction in Gary William Flake's booko The Computational Beauty of Nature.

The code is a bit raw, in that it does not support many of the things expected
of a screensaver in Windows (preview, multiple screen support and the like).

Installation
------------

The source code should be built with Visual Studio 2010.
The resulting .EXE file should be renamed to .SCR and copied to the following
folder, even on 64 bit editions of Windows:

    C:\Windows\System32
